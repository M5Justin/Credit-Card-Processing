## Description

Here at Bottom Line Financial we wanted to create an encryption model for credit cards. Financial data is the worst to have stolen. Post-covid, money has become more important than ever, to which we say: better safe than sorry.
The motivation for this project was to create something that we could 
be able to show future employers a system we’ve built to safely encrypt data


AS A USER, I want to be presented with the homepage. Upon logging in, I’m presented with the option to add new transactions and cards to be encrypted and stored.
